### Architecture
What is Software Architecture?

> **The common understanding how the thing works** is effectively **the architecture**. It is that fuzzy, embedded understanding what really matters. (...) There may be diagrams here and there, there may be documents (...) but they are just the representation, and usually an imperfect representation of that shared understanding. What you are trying to do with a software project, particularily as software projects grow, you want to make sure you have **a good shared understanding between the people** who are leading the project. That is really what matters.
