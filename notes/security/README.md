## Notes about software systems security

Practicing **Security by Design** implies thinking about security at each stage while desigining a system to meet functional and non-functional requirements. 

### STRIDE
The S.T.R.I.D.E. is a security threat model.

- **Spoofing** 
- **Tampering** happens when data (or system configuration) is altered in an unauthorised way due to some (external) interference 
- **Repudiation** happens when an actor (user or system) claims they have not performed an action (even though they in reality did)
- **Denial of Service** happens when a system becomes unavailable or its performance degrades
- **Information Disclosure** happens when an actor (user or system) leaks some information
- **Elevation of Priviledge** happens when an actor (user or system) gains capabilities they are not supposed to have
